TASK 0 
Download the COVID-19 dataset from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virusreport

1. Find countries with more than 100 deaths
2. Find top-5 countries of new cases
3. Extract rows whose WHO region is Europe
4. Which European country has the most active cases?




TASK 1

1. Import people’s weights (in pounds) and heights (in 
inches) from file weight-height.csv
2. Assign weights to variable ‘weights’ and heights to 
variable ‘height’ by slicing the array
3. Convert heights to centimeters and weights to 
kilograms using array operations
4. Find mean, median, variance and standard deviation 
of weights and heights separately

TASK 2

1. Import data from weight-height.csv
2. Box plot heights
3. Apply Winsorization method by removing 2% 
from left and right (hint: np.quantile())
4. Box plot the new data and compare
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 but using clamping 
instead of removing

TASK 3 

Import real-life student course data from file 
course_grades.csv. Consider only the last five columns
2. Investigate the relationship between
1. ‘STACKexer’ and ‘exercises’ columns
2. “exam1” and “exam2” columns
3. both ”exam” columns and final course grade 
(“grade” column)
3. Investigate the relationships of all five variables 
pairwise. What are the strongest relations? What are 
the weakest?
4. Use plots and computed quantities



TASK 4

1. Continue investigating the Boston housing 
dataset using multiple regression
2. Repeat old example/exercise from the class
room with two explanatory variables
3. Add more explanatory variables to the model
4. Which variables would you add and why?
5. How does adding more variables effect 
model’s performance? Compute metrics and 
compare to baseline case.
